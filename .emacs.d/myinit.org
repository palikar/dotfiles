* Abstract
This is the cofiguration of my EmonkeysMACS-Editor written in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate style programming]]. I've sort of hoarded a lot of different packages and different =.emacs= files from all over the internet and just stucked them together.\\
Using the configuraion as is it is is not really advisable. Some things may seem weird and 'wrongly' configured, but hey...this is EMACS.\\
Still, you may found some hidden gems in here that can greatly simplify your work with the editor. I don't use =use-package= as I found that it actually makes my emacs slugish on windows and I actually prefer to have everything in my local config all the time.\\

* Repos and packages
The default packages repo for emacs is ELPA. ELPA is not super good, we also want ELPA. +ELPA is configured in the .emacs file but here we also add ELPA for good measures+ Everything is here now!

** Installing packages
I use a lot of aditional packages and like to keep them local and installed. I've tried =use-package= but I had some issues and I've opted out for installing everything. The initial waiting when setting up emacs config from scratch is fine by me.

* Interface tweaks
Making the whole =emacs= experience a tiny bit better with those fixes of the interface of the editor
- Startup screen is anoying
- The toolbar is wasting sapce
- =f5= should function as a refresh in firefox
- Fringes waste space
- Numbered lines come in handy
- Highlighting the current line is pretty =übersichtlich=
- Pretty sybols like \lambda over the whole place is pretty cool

** Making parantesis handy and smart
Those are pretty much a must when editing code...and also anything else
- Select region and wrap it up with a sybol
  - Cofigured with the standards
  - Cofigured with the formating of =org-mode=
- Insert a opening bracecket and the closing is inserted automagically!

* Org-mode
** Common settings
Org-mode is awesome not just for note taking but also for general text editing, formating and all and all just plain old /writting/. Therefore some basic org-mode configuraion comes at handy when working with =.org= files (this .init file is written in org-mode so...yeah!!). The =org-bullets= makes the heading look pretty. I have couple of extra exporterrs for =.org= files that just make my life easier. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Exporters
Some extra export backends for org-mode that come in handy.
 - Beamer - for making those awesome-ish presentations
 - twbs(Tweeter Bootstrap) - quickly make your org files look really pretty
 - hugo - I use Hugo for blogging and the exporter allowes me to write every single content page in /org-mode/
 - gfm (Github Flavored Markdown) - this makes writing /README.md/ files easy (i.e. writing them in org-mode)
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

** Reveal.js
This style of presenting looks cool but I don't use it that much. Still, I want to have the possibility in my emacs. 
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'ox-reveal)

    (setq org-reveal-root "http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/reveal.js/3.0.0/")
    (setq org-reveal-mathjax t)

    (require 'htmlize)
#+END_SRC
** Reloading
For some reasons I have to call this after I've /require/-d all the exporters' backends in order to make them available in the export dispatcher of /org-mode/.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org)
(org-reload)

#+END_SRC
* Windowing
Couple of minor setups that make working with frames a little bit easier. In a lot of cases I just want to switch the position of two windows so there is handy function there. Also, navigating around windows can be a bit weird and slow with just using =C-x o= so =windmove= is set up to work with =C-c= and the arrow keys
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun transpose-windows (arg) ;; yes, I know, there is also a crux-function that does the exact same thing...still...!!!
   "Transpose the buffers shown in two windows."
   (interactive "p")
   (let ((selector (if (>= arg 0) 'next-window 'previous-window)))
     (while (/= arg 0)
       (let ((this-win (window-buffer))
             (next-win (window-buffer (funcall selector))))
         (set-window-buffer (selected-window) next-win)
         (set-window-buffer (funcall selector) this-win)
         (select-window (funcall selector)))
       (setq arg (if (plusp arg) (1- arg) (1+ arg))))))

 (define-key ctl-x-4-map (kbd "t") 'transpose-windows)

* Better searching
=Isearch= is great but I have ever wanted a isearch on steroids...or something with helm infused isearch. =Swiper= is exaclty that. =Anzu= is a mode line tweak that displays the number of found things by isearch but not by swiper. Yes, I should probably fix that some time in the future.

\\
/Note:/ I do also sometimes use /helm-occur-from-isearch/ in order to find something. I still like to have different possablities while performing an action and picking hte best one in each individual case.

#+END_SRC

* Helm goodies
The best and the most fully fledged completion engine for emacs IMO. I cannot be productive in my emacs without this. When you are in minibuffer and start typing, things just appear as you type, you can select multiple items, perform actions on all of the (example: open multiple files with single =C-x C-f=) and many more features that I should probalby use on more regular basis.

* Avy
Navigate by searching for a letter on the screen and jumping to it. Useful for quick navigation and getting to places on the screen.

#+END_SRC
* Iy
Go to next CHAR which is similar to "f" and "t" in /vim/. To note is that I don't think that this package will remember the state of your mark when you make the jump. So if you have the expression =int funcName(int a, int b)=, the cursor is at the beginnign of the epxresison and you type =C-SPC C-c f (= you wno't mark everything till the =(=. Still useful though.

* Company
Complete Anything! I am yet to find an effective setup that is as fast as well as feature rich. I've defined hooks for some of the major modes that I use so that I don't hold too many active backends at the start. A lot of times I found myself turning off company-mode because it just makes the typing slower at some moments. The ~company-idle-delay~ makes the automatic popup impossible so that I would have to call it manually through =M-m=.

* Yasnippet
One of the most useful packages that is pretty much a must for a emacs configuration. The package provides a whole bunch of very handy snippets for code/text/structures in almost all major modes of emacs. The default prefix for some of the yas functions is =C-c &= but this really doesn't work for me. Therefore I've defined custom keybindings for the important functions. Also, I write a lot in c++, so I often found myself in the situation where I first expand a ~std::vector~ and then I want to give it a type of ~std::sting~. Stacked snippets are my best friend when it comes to this problem.

* Misc packages
Those pacakges add some minor tweak to EMACS to make text editing easier.
- [[https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon][beacon]] - flashes your cursor after the cursor has been re-positioned.
- [[https://github.com/nflath/hungry-delete]] - deletes all of the white spaces that are 'on the way' after hitting /delete/ or /backspace/. It's weird at first but then you get use to it and kinda crave it and feel its lack if not there.
- [[https://github.com/magnars/expand-region.el][expand-region]] - kinda of a wannabe of that one vim functionality where you select everything between two braces with few simple strokes. This is more powerful but not that precise, to put it mildly. Not that it's not good. Just hit key binding and you can grow the region in both sides by 'semantic increments', whatever that's supposed to mean.

Surprisingly I don't have all that much tweaks in here. Commenting out regions or lines is probably the thing I use the most. The other things are just very minor things that are standard in every other IDE.

* Projectile
The de-facto standard for project management for emacs. Not sure if I utilize half of its functionality but this file searching and opening...man that feels good when putting it to use. When in a project(which is just a git-repo btw) just type =C-c p f= and be blown away. When you we *helm* with *projectile*, we pretty much get one of the most powerful features in the history of IDEs ever. Some of my relevant keybindings include:
- =f4= - switch to other file. For working with /.cpp/ and /.hpp/ files
- =C-c p f= for finding files the easiest way possible.
- =C-c p d= for finding directories the easiest way possible.
- =M-s= helm-projectile-grep - really cool for searching a phrase of something in a entire project
- =C-c p 4 f= - find file and open it in another window
- =C-c p F= - find file in all known projects
- =C-c p 4 F= find file in all known projects and open it in another window
- =C-c p e= - see recent files
- =C-c p x s= run shell at the root of the project
- =C-c p S= save all files of the current project

My tree browser of choice. Was blown away when I found that emacs has the ability to pull of something like tree browser.

* Shell
My choce of terminal envinroment in my emacs is /Terminal Emulator/(term). There are two modes to it - /char/ and /line/. Switching between them is made easier with one simple function and some custom key-bindings.

 May other IDEs use =F5= for building and compiling projects and I've gotten used to that. Therefore...custom keybinding.

Yes, I am a hirroble speller. Thank god that there are tools that help me live my miserable uneducated life. I often have to write in german too so I have custom dictionary switching key-binding.

This is absolutely a genius thing! Mark something, simple key-stroke, BAM!! Google! You are there! You have no idea how much copying and windows switching this package saves. Again, for intuition sake, =C-c g= is the prefix. After that:
- =w= for word
- =s= for selection
- =g= for google
- =SPC= for region
- =l= for line
- =c= for cpp-reference
